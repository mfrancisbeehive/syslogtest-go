# This Dockerfile works by first building the application in a container with the Golang image, and then copying the
# binary to a smaller image for running the application. The final image is based on the alpine image, which is a very
# small Linux distribution. The point of doing this is to make the final image as small as possible.

# Use the official Golang image as the base image for building
FROM golang:alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the source code
COPY . .

# Build the binary, with all the dependencies included
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o syslogtest-go ./cmd/syslogtest-go

FROM alpine:latest as certs
RUN apk --update add ca-certificates
